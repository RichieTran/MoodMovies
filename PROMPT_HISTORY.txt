Basically used Claude's Sonnet model to create the basic code for each file. Then I updated and added some parts with the help of AI.

1. I am creating a website with python that uses TMDB and OMDb APIs to recommend movies based on mood and/or movie preference and/or similar movies. Create the files needed with boilerplate code for now. Dont forget the .env and .gitignore (I have the two api keys already)

2. okay can you change the buttons to instead of having gradients, be this color #232d5e, also change the background behind the main white page to this color #001221

3. can you make the colors similar to the colors in this picture (not including the posters)

4. instead of #0ea5e9 can you make it #165a94

5. Now I want it so when you are on a modal for a movie, it should show 5ish other similar movies.

6. Okay now, I want to change some style things, first can you add a favicon (make it the movie clip emoji that is infront of MoodMovies. Then add the rotton tomatoes rating to the modals using "&tomatoes=true" before "&apikey=MY_KEY" in omdb api calls. This will return a ratings array which will contain imdb and rotton tomatos rartings, display both. Also instead of the star emoji with rating, display the IMDB rating and Rotton tomatoes rating.

7. I meant on the movie descriptions before you click it (so before the modal) right now it is a star emoji with the ratings, change that to "IMDb: ... RT: ..." with the ratings

8. Can you change it actually so every movie has 10 grey stars, then the amount of stars the movie has is in yellow

9. can you create a half yellow half grey star instead? I think that is better instead of rounding, so if any movie has a decimal point over .2 and under .8 then give them a half gray and half yellow star so like 7.5 would be 7 yellow stars, a half half, and 2 grey stars

10. Okay perfect, but I actually want 5 stars because 10 is to much. So can you change it so each tmdb rating is converted into a 5 star rating system. If there are 7 stars for exampe then I want to change that to 3.5/5 stars since 7/2 is 3.5. You can keep the same logic for the half star, if the converted rating is 4.2 then give it 4.5 stars for exapmle

11. Okay final thing, I dont like how each of the buttons for the genre, feeling, and quick access are different. Can you make it so all of the buttons follow the same css (hover, default, etc.) as the buttons in the choose a genre section

12. Okay finally can you make it so the button that is clicked stays blue instead of resetting, so the user knows which button they last pressed
